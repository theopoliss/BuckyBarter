BuckyBarter is a mobile-first marketplace app designed exclusively for university students to buy, sell, and trade items within their campus community. Users sign up using a verified .edu email, and have the option to enhance trust through ID and selfie verification. The platform offers a streamlined experience for posting listings, managing offers, and chatting with buyers and sellersâ€”all in a secure, student-only environment. BuckyBarter aims to replace platforms like Facebook Marketplace for college campuses with a cleaner, safer, and more tailored alternative.
